# Design Studio Feedback on Final Project

We received feedback from Ben Shryock. 
The points discussed in the design studio are outlined below.

###1.	Data organization and structure

In discussing the best way to arrange and organize our code, we came to the conclusion that the structure of our code will take the form of homework 3. We will have an index file, which loads in the data and event handlers that call various files containing our structural elements and visual designs. This design of our code will make it easier to collaborate on and will be the best form to maintain our organization.

###2.	  Design Feature 

In discussing our map design feature, Ben suggested that the bubbles could implement two design features rather than one. By adding a color gradient aspect to the station bubble stops indicating a percentage capacity full, we can display more information to the user. The size of the bubble for each stop will indicate the capacity and the color of each bubble will represent the capacity full for the specified date and time that the user selects. 

###3.	New Target Audience 

Our initial thought was that Hubway would be our main target audience. Upon further discussion, we came to the conclusion that Hubway users would benefit greatly, if not more so, than Hubway itself from this visual implementation. Hubway users can visualize if bikes will be available on specific dates and times based on the percentage full color gradient at each Hubway stop. They can also see what station has the most bikes based on the size of the station and plan their trips accordingly.
